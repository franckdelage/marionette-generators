Description:
  Creates a folder and files structure for a full Marionette app inside a Rails app

Example:
    rails generate marionette:app Name_of_app 

    This will create:
      app/assets/javascripts/name_of_app_app.js
      app/assets/javascripts/backbone/name_of_app.js.coffee
      app/assets/templates/layouts/layout.jst.skim
      app/assets/javascripts/backbone/utils/logger.js.coffee
      app/assets/javascripts/backbone/utils/defaults.js.coffee
      app/assets/javascripts/backbone/config.js.coffee
      app/assets/javascripts/backbone/views/layouts/layout.js.coffee
      app/assets/javascripts/backbone/routers/app_router.js.coffee
      app/views/layouts/application.html.slim

    This will also install 3 gems : bower-rails, slim-rails and skim

    This will create a index.html.slim in app/views/[your_home_controller]
    with a starter for the marionette app

    In the end, you should see in your browser the message "Hello there, I'm the [Name_of_app] Marionette app !"
